## Problem

Senior Software Engineer Take-Home Programming Assignment for Rust

Story: There are over 100,000 flights a day, with millions of people and cargo being transferred around the world. With so many people, and different carrier/agency groups it can be hard to track where a person might be. In order to determine the flight path of a person, we must sort through all of their flight records.

Goal: To create a microservice API that can help us understand and track how a particular personâ€™s flight path may be queried. The API should accept a request that includes a list of flights, which are defined by a source and destination airport code. These flights may not be listed in order and will need to be sorted to find the total flight paths starting and ending airports.

Examples:

```sh
[['SFO', 'EWR']]                                                 => ['SFO', 'EWR']
[['ATL', 'EWR'], ['SFO', 'ATL']]                                 => ['SFO', 'EWR']
[['IND', 'EWR'], ['SFO', 'ATL'], ['GSO', 'IND'], ['ATL', 'GSO']] => ['SFO', 'EWR']
```

Specifications:

Define and document the format of the API endpoint in the README.

Use Rust and/or with any tools that you think will help you best accomplish the task at hand.

## Analysis

After studying the problem, I found that it is a typical Euler Graph problem.We can think of the location as point, and think of the flight as a arrow line. So the problem turns out to be how to find a path to walk though all the points.

Then the problem can be divided into a few steps:

Step 1: find the start point and the end point. When the two points connected with the arrow line, let's calcuate the start point *out* count add 1, and the end point *in* count add 1.

  > Scene 1: The graph is not loop, you can find that the final path start point is the one which `out - in = 1`, and the end point is the one which `in - out = 1`.
  > Scene 2: The graph is loop, the you can start from any point, and you will finally walk back to it.

Step 2: Then let's search from the start point with DFS and Backtrace. When there are many solutions, use min lexicographical order.

## Checklists

- [x] axum as web.
- [x] github CI test.
- [x] log elapsed time.
- [x] deploy online. curl example.
- [x] Dockerfile to deploy.
- [x] validate input.
- [x] full document to explain the algorithm.

## Solution API Server Online

I have deployed the solution to my own cloud server.

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:2333/solution' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "flights": [
        ["IND", "EWR"],
        ["SFO", "ATL"],
        ["GSO", "IND"],
        ["ATL", "GSO"]
    ]
}'
```

## APIs

`Get /health`

will always return `OK`

`Post /solution`
